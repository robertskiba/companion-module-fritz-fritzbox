## FRITZ!Box

Shows the status of a FRITZ!Box router on buttons and controls the smart home devices connected to it: sockets, lamps, thermostats, blinds, contacts and buttons.

> **Beta:** this module has been tested with a real FRITZ!Box. Since boxes differ a lot (DSL, cable, fibre, LTE/5G, smart home devices), we are looking for beta testers. Please report what works and what does not at https://github.com/robertskiba/companion-module-fritz-fritzbox/issues, with the model, FRITZ!OS version and connection type, and attach a diagnostics report (see below).

### Preparing the FRITZ!Box

1. **Create a user for Companion** under _System > FRITZ!Box Users_ and give it the rights **FRITZ!Box Settings** and **Smart Home**. Without "FRITZ!Box Settings" most router values stay empty, and without "Smart Home" the devices cannot be read or switched.
2. **Allow access for applications** under _Home Network > Network > Network Settings_. This switches on TR-064, which the router status is read through.
3. Optional: in the same place, switch on **Transmit status information over UPnP**. Only the IPv6 address and prefix need it, plus a fallback for the throughput values.

The smart home part needs **FRITZ!OS 8.20 or later**. On older firmware the router status still works, and the log says why smart home does not.

### Configuration

| Field                  | Meaning                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Address                | Where the box is, e.g. `192.168.178.1` or `https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.myfritz.net:43167`                       |
| User name / Password   | The user created above                                                                                       |
| Router status interval | How often connection state and throughput are read. Addresses, WLAN and network devices are read every 30 s. |
| Smart home interval    | How often all smart home devices are read in one request. 0 switches smart home off.                         |

The address decides everything else: `https://` switches on encryption, a number after the colon is the port, and without one the standard port is used (80, or 443 with `https://`). How TR-064 is reached is found out automatically when connecting.

### A box somewhere else

A FRITZ!Box that is not in the same network as Companion is reached through its remote access over the internet:

1. Give the Companion user the right **Access from the internet allowed** (_System > FRITZ!Box Users_).
2. Switch on the internet access of the box and give it a name on the internet. That can be the free **MyFRITZ!** service of the box (an address ending in `.myfritz.net`) or **any other dynamic DNS service** set up on the box.
3. Look up the **port** of the remote access under _Internet > MyFRITZ! Account_ (_Internet > MyFRITZ!-Konto_). The box picks this port itself and it differs from box to box.
4. Enter the address as `https://<name>:<port>`, e.g. `https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.myfritz.net:43167` or `https://studio.example-dyndns.org:43167`.

Over the internet the box only speaks HTTPS, and everything (login, smart home and TR-064) goes through that one port. The IPv6 address and prefix and the UPnP throughput fallback are not available this way; everything else is.

### Variables

All variables follow one scheme, so every value has an obvious place:

| Prefix               | Contents                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `device_`            | The box itself                                                |
| `connection_wan1_`   | The main internet connection, whatever the technology         |
| `connection_wan2_`   | A second connection, e.g. a mobile stick as backup            |
| `connection_dsl_`    | Values only a DSL line has                                    |
| `connection_fiber_`  | Values only a fibre line has                                  |
| `connection_cable_`  | Values only a cable box has                                   |
| `connection_mobile_` | Values only a mobile connection has (LTE/5G box or USB stick) |
| `wlan_`              | The wireless networks                                         |
| `lan_`               | Devices in the home network                                   |
| `smarthome_`         | The smart home devices                                        |

Groups that only some boxes have (WAN 2, DSL, fibre, cable, mobile) only appear on those boxes. A mobile connection counts as WAN 2 when it runs beside a DSL, cable, fibre or Ethernet connection; on a pure LTE/5G box it is WAN 1. Values the box does not report stay empty.

#### WLAN

Each network gets its own prefix by band, so the names are the same on every model: `wlan_24ghz_`, `wlan_5ghz_`, `wlan_6ghz_` and `wlan_guest_`. A second network on the same band gets a number, e.g. `wlan_5ghz_2_`.

| Variable             | Meaning                          | Example    |

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `smarthome_units` | Number of smart home units (devices, groups) | `6`     |

Every unit also gets its own prefix: always one from its ID, e.g. `smarthome_11630_0015376_`, and if no other unit has the same name, a second one from its name, e.g. `smarthome_steckdose_regie_`. Umlauts are written out (`ü` becomes `ue`). Which of the following a unit has depends on the device:

| Ending         | Meaning                                   | Example                      |

### Router status

Action: **Internet: reconnect now** drops the internet connection so the box dials in again at once, usually with a new IP address. The internet is gone for a few seconds; over MyFRITZ! the module also loses the box until the new address has reached the DNS, and then reconnects by itself.

Feedbacks: connected, internet connected, line synchronised, WLAN enabled (guest, per band or any), network device online (by MAC, IP or name), and throughput above or below a value.

### Smart home

The variables are listed in the tables above.

Actions: switch on, off or toggle; brightness; colour and colour temperature; blind up, down, stop and position; thermostat temperature (set, raise, lower, ON, OFF), boost and window open mode; apply a template or scenario; enable or disable a routine.

Feedbacks: switched on, reachable, alert or contact state, compare a reading (temperature, power, humidity ...), boost, window open mode, battery low, button pressed recently, routine enabled.

Presets are created for every device the box reports.

### Diagnostics report

The action **Write diagnostics report** writes a file named `fritzbox-diagnostics-<date>.json` into the home folder of the computer running Companion; the log shows the exact path. It holds what the box offers and answers over TR-064, the smart home overview as the box sends it, the recent requests and problems, and the router values. Passwords and session ids are never included. IP and MAC addresses, network and device names, serial numbers, the user name and the address of the box are replaced by placeholders such as `IPv4#1`, so the report can be shared as it is.

### Good to know

- Battery powered thermostats only talk to the box every few minutes. A new target temperature is accepted at once but may take a while to show as the current state.
- The box only reports a button press when it is next read, so the "button pressed" feedback can lag by up to the smart home interval.
- The module holds one login session on the box and logs out when the connection is disabled.
- When the box is unreachable, e.g. during the nightly reconnect of the internet line, the module says so once in the log and connects again by itself as soon as the box answers. Over MyFRITZ! or another dynamic DNS name that is as soon as the name points to the new IP address. Nothing needs to be restarted.
